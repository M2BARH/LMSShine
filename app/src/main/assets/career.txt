        Hello There!!

Did you know that High Schools are categorised base on the stream they offer??
Oh you might be asking, what is a stream/streaming?? Well 'Streaming' usually involves grouping students into classes for all or most of their lessons, so that a student is in the same group regardless of the subject being taught.
To mention a few streams, the is Agriculture, Commerce, Science, Technical, etc... Hence based on this streams, we have, Agriculture School, Commerce School, Science School, Technical School. You get the idea.

Now, based on the career that you want to pursue after Tertiary, you have to choose a right High School to go to. The one that offers stream that will let you study for the course you want.

If you want to be a software developer or a data analyst, the you must go to a Science School. But if you want to be a Farmer, then you must go to an Agriculture School.
With this information, you won't go wrong with your career choice.
